# my-portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio repository! 
This repo showcases my projects, resume, and other materials. My interests are many and I will be updating this repo with new materials as I create them.

## About Me
I'm an undergraduate student at NC State University majoring in Statistics with a concentration in Data Science and minoring in Accounting and Business Administration.
I enjoy using code to uncover actionable insights hidden in large datasets across many disciplines. 
I’m especially interested in applying data science techniques to business strategy, business planning, and entrepreneurial or creative ventures.

Outside of academics, I’m passionate about the arts. I’ve been playing piano for 15 years and am currently learning guitar. 
I also enjoy drawing and painting, and I aspire to be a writer of fiction and poetry. 
These creative interests shape the way I think about problem‑solving and bring a unique perspective to my work.

## Repository Structure

- **projects/**  
  Each of my projects lives in its own folder. More projects will be added as I continue building and refining my work.

- **resume/**  
  A copy of my resume will be available here soon.
