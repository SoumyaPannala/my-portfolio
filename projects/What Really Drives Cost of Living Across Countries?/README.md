# What Really Drives Cost of Living Across Countries?

## Overview
This project uses R and three Kaggle datasets to explore global cost of living patterns. I examined the factors that influence cost of living, identified countries with favorable conditions depending on different goals (such as relocation or foreign business planning), and analyzed where trends appear to be heading.

## Goals
- Apply more advanced data management and analysis techniques to large, messy datasets  
- Practice integrating multiple data sources into a cohesive analysis  
- Strengthen my ability to communicate findings clearly through both code and visualizations  

## Contents
- Three Kaggle data files  
- Quarto Markdown HTML document (includes code, analysis, and written interpretation)
