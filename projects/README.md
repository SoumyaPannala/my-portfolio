# Projects

This folder contains all of my projects across data science, business, creative work, and anything else I explore. Each project lives in its own subfolder and includes a README with details about the work, methods, and takeaways.

As I continue learning and experimenting, I’ll be adding new projects that reflect both my analytical interests and my creative pursuits.

## How This Folder Is Organized
- Each project has its own dedicated folder.
- Project names are descriptive so you can quickly understand the topic or focus.
- Every project folder includes:
  - A README explaining the project
  - Any code, data, images, or other materials used
  - Full report with analysis and written interpretation of findings.
  - Poster files for those presented to an audience if applicable.

## Types of Projects You May Find Here
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Business or strategy‑focused explorations  
- Creative projects in art, writing, or music  
- Miscellaneous experiments and learning exercises  

This structure keeps everything organized while giving me the freedom to explore a wide range of interests.
